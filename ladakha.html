    <h1>LADAKH TOURISM</h1>
    <h2>Pangong Lake</h2>
    <img src="https://images.thrillophilia.com/image/upload/s--IlB7x7Rm--/c_fill,g_center,h_450,q_auto,w_753/dpr_1.0,f_auto,fl_strip_profile/v1/images/photos/000/053/679/original/1644663710_shutterstock_796094905.jpg.jpg">
    <p>Pangong Lake Overview
        Heaven, Peace, Silence, and Tranquility at one place? Come and spend a few hours at Pangong Lake in Ladakh! A pristine place in Ladakh marked by subtle to high peaks around, crystal blue waters and the vast expansion catches the eye so much, so long as if a magic is happening right in front of the eyes.
        
        Pangong Lake, also known as Pangong Tso, lies calmly at a breathtaking elevation of 14,270 feet. Interestingly, the lake is 12 km long and marks itself between the laps of India and China. Rather, 60% of the portion is stretching in the neighboring nation and this excites every traveler to be here.
        
        The surreal clean blue waters are actually brackish or salty in nature and this feature doesn’t let any aquatic life survive in the same. Moreover, the temperature range between -30 to -10 degrees make even this salty lake freeze with thick ice sheets, which is quite opposite in case of salt ridden water bodies.</p>
    <h2>Khardungla Pass</h2>
    <img src="https://images.thrillophilia.com/image/upload/s--RJF24N-S--/c_fill,g_center,h_450,q_auto,w_753/dpr_1.0,f_auto,fl_strip_profile/v1/images/photos/000/053/719/original/1489644069_IMG_20160708_123215.jpg.jpg">
    <p>Khardung La pass is a gateway to some of the most enchanting and unexplored landscapes. This famed mountain pass is very popular amongst adventure seekers and regular tourists alike. Located in the Leh district of the Indian Union Territory, Khardung La is situated at an elevation of 5,359 meters. It is hailed to be the highest motorable pass all across the globe. Historically speaking, Khardung La is quite significant as it lies on the major caravan route that links Leh to Kashgar in Central Asia.

        During the second world war, an attempt to transfer war well to China was made through this route. Khardung La was constructed in the year 1976 and was made accessible to public motor vehicles in the year 1988. The pass is maintained by the Border Roads Organisation and is of great strategic importance as it is used to carry goods to the Siachen Glacier. </p>
    <h2>Magnetic Hill</h2>

    <p>Located at an elevation of 14,000 feet, Magnetic Hill in Ladakh is one of the most mysterious and intriguing places to visit in the country. This small cyclops hillock is said to be a place where the forces of gravity are defied, as it is here where vehicles seem to be pulled in an upwards direction on the hill. While there are several scientific theories that could debunk the mystery of this unique phenomenon, there is also the rather common local superstition, that states that the Magnetic Hill Road is a direct “stairway to heaven.”

        The road to Magnetic Hill is home to a signboard that reads, “Magnetic Hill – the Phenomenon that defies Gravity,” along with a white box that asks you to park your vehicle there. Upon parking your vehicle in neutral gear, you can eventually see them moving uphill at a speed of around 10 to 20 km/hr, all by itself, against the force of gravity. </p>
    <h2>Diskit Gompa</h2>

    <p>Perched at an altitude of 3,144 m, the Diskit Gompa is the largest surviving monastery in the Nubra Valley in Leh. Belonging to the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism, this monastery is settled along the slope of a mountain. It overlooks the pristine snow-capped Himalayan peaks and the stunning flood plains of the Shyok River that present a remarkable sight to behold.

        The Gompa is famous not only for its serene surroundings but for the historical and mythological significance that it boasts of. While the statue of Maitreya Buddha pleases the visitors with its unmatched elegance and 100 ft height. The beautiful paintings of different deities of Buddhism, stunning fresco, and grand architecture are majestic as well.
