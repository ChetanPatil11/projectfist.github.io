   <h1>AGRA TOURISM</h1> 
   <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
   <img src="C:\Users\hp\Downloads\html\india-top-attractions-taj-mahal.jpg">
   <p>The very first thing every tourist who comes to Agra wants to do is see the beauty that is Taj Mahal. No matter how many times you’ve been here, it will leave you mesmerized with its intricate carvings and architecture. The Taj Mahal is certainly the main attraction that draws millions of tourists to Agra every year and rightly so. Called the epitome of love, it was constructed by Shah Jahan for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal whose tomb rests right under the central dome of the monument. It took 22 years and over 20,000 workers to construct this marvel. Shah Jahan spent his last years imprisoned in the Agra Fort gazing at his creation and after his death, his tomb was placed inside the Taj Mahal next to his wife. The white marble monument is an architectural marvel with fine detailing, on the south bank of the Yamuna River. Verses from the Holy Quran are inscribed on it, gemstones adorn its walls and the intricate inlay work adds a touch of magnificence to the structure. Another brilliant fact that makes it a masterpiece is its symmetry, which is why it looks the same from all four sides.


    Being one of the Seven Wonders of the World and the only one in India doesn’t stop from wrong stories floating around the Taj Mahal. Ones like the Taj Mahal was also to be built in black marble or that Shah Jahan dismembered the arms of the artisans who built the monument are pretty common but not really true. But one true and fascinating story  is that Agra was not the first choice to build the Taj Mahal. Yes, the world famous monument was originally planned to be constructed in Madhya Pradesh in Burhanpur because Mumtaz Mahal passed away there. Shah Jahan had even marked out the site along the Tapti River where it was to be built but the plan was shelved when Burhanpur was unable to supply enough white marble that was required for its construction. And so, Agra got its iconic monument that we call the Taj Mahal.
    
    Admire its striking beauty yourself when here. The Taj Mahal is open for visitors between 6 am to 6 pm but remains shut on Fridays. The entry fee for Indians is Rs 20 and for foreign nationals it is Rs 750. According to one legend, if you walk away from the Taj Mahal and look back, you are likely to come back for another visit. Would you?</p>
   <h2>Agra Fort</h2>
   <img src="https://assets.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE-%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE-%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE.jpg">
   <p>Another architectural jewel in this city is the Agra Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was built by Mughal Emperor Akbar with the help of 4,000 workers who worked for eight years to finish its construction in 1573. Agra Fort is made of red sandstone and was the seat of the Mughal Empire. Some of the major attractions in Agra Fort that will leave you mesmerized are structures like the Sheesh Mahal, Moti Mahal, Jehangirs Palace and Khas Mahal. The fort has four large gate of which the Delhi Gate was used for the kings formal entry. Diwan-i-Khas and Diwan-i-Aam were reserved for royal audience and the public respectively.

    Agra Fort has been prominent during the Mughal reign. Even though Akbar built it, during the rule of Shah Jahan, he renovated it by adding marble work and converting the raw red sandstone structure to a palace. Years later, his son Aurangzeb imprisoned him in the same fort at Mussaman Burj. Do pay a visit to this part of the fort as it offers one of the best views of the Taj Mahal. Despite these changes, Agra Fort is an epitome of Mughal architecture at its best and shouldnt be missed.
    
    Agra Fort is open to tourists all days of the week from 7 am to 6 pm. For Indians, the entry fee is Rs 20 while for foreigners it is Rs 300. It is spread across 94 acres so you will need about two hours to explore the entire monument.</p>
   <h2>Fatehpur Sikri

</h2>
   <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Jama-Masjid-Fatehpur-Sikri-shutterstock_89956735.jpg">
   <p>One of Emperor Akbar’s pet projects was building a walled city a little away from Agra. He called it Fatehpur Sikri and even ruled here for sometime before he was forced to move out due to shortage of water supply. Nevertheless, the surviving monuments tell a tale of his valour and great work. Fateh in Persian signifies victory. The city survived and three of its walled sides are still intact. Akbar paid keen interest in its architecture and layout and it took about 15 years to plan and build it completely. Once ready, it had palaces, harems, buildings, courts and a mosque. But one of the best architectural wonders of Fatehpur Sikri is the Buland Darwaza, a grand gateway to the walled city. Made of red sandstone, there are 52 steps that lead up to its 175 ft high archway that has two inscriptions. Akbar’s favorite minister Birbal too has a monument in Fatehpur Sikri called Birbal’s house. Since he was a Hindu, the architecture is different than the usual Mughal buildings.


    One of the first buildings to be constructed in Fatehpur Sikri was the Jama Masjid, a mosque built according to Indian mosque architecture. It also houses the tomb of Salim Chishti, a great Sufi saint. Akbar, who was the founder of the faith Din-e-Ilahi also constructed Ibadat Khana in Fatehpur Sikri which was used for meetings. The Panch Mahal, a five-storey palatial structure was for the ladies and the Naubat Khana that had drummers announce the entry of the emperor were other unique structures in this city. Despite the lavish architecture and careful planning, Fatehpur Sikri was abandoned in 1585 after ruling it from 1571. This was because the lake that supplied water to the city dried up. Even so, it is worth marvelling the beauty of what a magnificent city this once was. Fatehpur Sikri is about 37 km away from Agra but can be completed on the same trip. Most of the city lies uninhabited and reminds one of its once glorious past. You can find a few budget hotels to stay at near the Fatehpur Sikri Railway Station. Don’t miss visiting this place as it is another UNESCO World Heritage Site.
    
    Akbar’s Tomb
    
    Akbar the Great built some majestic monuments in his lifetime and one of them was his tomb itself. The task of commissioning your own tomb is part of Turkic custom that Mughals adhered to. He even selected the site where he wanted to be kept. His last resting place, Sikandra is where Akbar’s Tomb is. His son Jehangir completed the construction of his father’s tomb in 1613 and it was beautifully carved, made of red sandstone. Just 1 km away from Akbar’s Tomb is Mariam’s Tomb, who was Akbar’s wife and Jehangir’s mother. The monument is open for visitors on all days of the week from 6 am to 6 pm. The entry fee for Indians is Rs 15 and for foreigners it is Rs 110.</p>
   <h2>Mehtab Bagh</h2>
   <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mehtab-Bagh.jpg">
   <p>Translating to moonlight garden, Mehtab Bagh is the perfect spot for admiring the beauty of the Taj Mahal. Built by Babur, it is a square garden that was once resplendent with pools, fountains and trees. Today, it makes for a recreational tourist spot. A Mughal garden, it is perfectly aligned with the Taj Mahal along the Yamuna River and was described by Shah Jahan as the ideal spot for viewing the Taj Mahal.

    Due to frequent floods and extraction of building material by the villagers, the garden lay in ruins by the ‘90s. However, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) intervened and started work to restore the garden to its original state. They even made sure that the plants used in Mehtab Bagh were ones that were originally a part of Mughal gardens. These included guava, Ashoka, jamun, neem, hibiscus, etc. There were four sandstone towers too in the garden at its four corners, however, only one remains now. During the restoration, other structures were added to Mehtab Bagh that were not originally a part of it. Some of these include a statue of BR Ambedkar holding the constitution of India, a temple and nurseries. Visit Mehtab Bagh between 6 am to 7 pm, it is open on all days of the week. The entry fee for Indians is Rs 5 while for foreign nationals it is Rs 100.</p>
